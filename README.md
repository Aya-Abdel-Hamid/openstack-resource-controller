# openstack-resource-controller
ORC is a set of Kubernetes controllers that manage your OpenStack tenant infrastructure.

You declare your OpenStack resource as a YAML file, you `kubectl apply` it and ORC provisions it on your OpenStack cloud.

## Description

ORC defines each OpenStack resource type as a CRD (see [./api/v1alpha1/](https://github.com/gophercloud/openstack-resource-controller/tree/main/api/v1alpha1)). Each resource type has its own controller (see [./internal/controller/](https://github.com/gophercloud/openstack-resource-controller/tree/main/internal/controller)). Controllers are responsible for creating and deleting resources in OpenStack when a CRD is created or deleted in their Kubernetes namespace.

## State of the project

**This project is currently in a prototype phase. Do NOT use in production.**

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=quay.io/orc/orc:main
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.
